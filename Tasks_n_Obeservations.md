## Tasks:

1. see if we can use one hot encoding in orientation feature.




------

## Observations:
1. Orientation feature seems categorical data for directions as East, West, North and South. If we had more data for calculation we can do better job. Like if we can add some wight to it based on the direction.

2. CSV files are simpler and more lightweight than Excel files. CSV files are plain text files that store data in a tabular format, with each row representing a data point and each column representing a feature. This makes them easy to read and write, and they are also relatively small in size. Excel files, on the other hand, are more complex and can store a wider variety of data types, including text, numbers, dates, and formulas. However, this also makes them larger in size and more difficult to read and write.
CSV files are more portable than Excel files. CSV files can be easily opened and read by a wide variety of software applications, including spreadsheets, statistical software, and machine learning frameworks. Excel files, on the other hand, can only be opened and read by Microsoft Excel. This makes CSV files more portable and easier to share with others.
Excel files offer more features for data analysis and visualization. So our main aim is to do the prediction so after train and test split we will store data in the form of CSV....

3. At the initial stages make sure you create a venv and run requirements.txt with -e . so... your project will be created as package.
